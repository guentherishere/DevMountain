jQuery
Instructor: AJ
Suggestion:

xml was briefly used and replaced by json

ajax = web requests, or http requests

CORS // Cross-Origin Resource Sharing // - anything that supports this you can
use straight from the browser since server is not required

The "GET" returns an object. The ".then" is what

Always separate your API from your html
