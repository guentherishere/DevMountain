Firebase - noSql, JSON based
Can not have a zero index array in Firebase, instead firebase uses push keys

Can't do three way data bind on array

If you're working with a Date you need to use toString(). Do not try to save them as objects. You can do this with ng-change
ex: chatroom.date = chatroomDate.toString();

keep data structures shallow since firebase automatically grabs ALL of the children

server to handle secure elements like credit card transactions etc
